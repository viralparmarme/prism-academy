              <p>I am Dhruv Mane, grateful to be a student of prism academy. All the teachers at the academy were approachable for even
              the smallest of doubts and were excellent at encouraging and motivating me to do better consistently. Every after the
              exams, the teachers were helpful in guiding
              me for my future endeavours.
              <br><br>
              Regular tests pushed me to prepare myself and so helped me to keep in touch with all subjects. Initially the marks being
              posted in the groups was embarrassing but gradually it became the motivation to perform better. I am thankful to the
              entire faculty to help me reach this
              small but crucial milestone in my life.

              Tarun Sir for the other two sciences and Priyanka miss for the subject of ICT, these three professors have helped me
              flourish in the respective fields and beyond.

              probably would have laughed and dismissed them. But thanks to my professors at PRISM, that urged me to better myself, I
              was able to achieve this feat. The large amounts of HW and the disciplined yet fun atmosphere of the class, along with
              guidance of my professors, I advanced both as a student and a teenager. It also instilled a habit of working hard and
              studying daily, whilst constantly trying to become a better version of myself. So thank you professor and PRISM Academy.

              <p>Prism academy has always been my go-to stop for any doubt. It has been a rollercoaster ride starting from day 1. The way
              Rishab sir put in efforts behind us, made it really easier for us to overcome any difficult issue. The guidance given to
              us can never be replaced and the explanations made during classes, were crystal clear. 
              <br><br>
              Prism academy and Rishab sir
              taught me not to hesitate to raise questions if you dont understand something and one can never go wrong if they're
              under the guidance of this academy. It has been a magnificent experience when it comes to passing days and working hard
              behind maths and science in Prism academy.
              A big thank you to Prism academy and Rishab sir for making me what i am, today!

              <p>I was with rishab sir for two years. He taught so well that all my concepts are clear. He was with me till my exam,
              solving all my doubts and taking prelims for practice and again helping me to solve and explained me the mistake I made
              during the prelim which really helped me in my final exams. Thanks for your support and will always remember you

              <p>The past two years of my life have been the most important and crucial years as I had my 10th board exams. But I am
              thankful to Prism Academy for making my journey smooth and interesting. The sirs and teachers are good at their teaching
              and never get tired from solving our simplest doubts. For a student one of the most essential requirement is receiving
              personal attention from its teachers to identify his/her weak areas to work towards its improvement and Prism Academy
              never fails to provide such atmosphere, attention and comfort. 
              <br><br>
              The teachers, especially our maths sir, Mr.Rishabh
              Rathod, have always been supportive and are always there for us to get better and clearer at our concepts even just the
              day before our exams. We had regular assignments and extra classes so that we could be thorough with our portion. I am
              really glad to be a part of such a wonderful academy where teachers invest more time and efforts than any other classes
              to build a child’s future.

              <p>My experience at Prism Academy has been a memorable one. Teachers here have helped me a lot. There used to be personal
              one to one doubt classes taken by sir. All the concepts taught by them were very clear. Since I joined Prism Academy
              there has been a constant improvement in my marks. The atmosphere there helped me in concentrate in my studies a lot.
              Even if we sat there for some extra time there was never a problem. Prism Academy has helped me score really good marks
              in my boards. I will never forget this Academy. Thanks a lot.

              system of first teaching and making us learn then followed by weekly tests is really practical and the punctuality here
              is excellent. I still remember it was my last day with Rishab Sir for math, right before the board exam when he wasn't
              feeling well still he refused to go home and sat with me to clear my doubts. Furthermore , at prism academy I studied
              with some elements of fun too which made academics interesting.

              <br>Rishab Sir extends unconditional support to all of his students. He uses interactive and engaging teaching
